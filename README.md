# Mockup Designer

Mockup Designer is probably the smallest and easiest mockup tool ever made. It is just one portable executable file with no dependencies, requires no installation, supported on both Windows and MacOS (and soon it will be available on Linux too).

You can express your UI design ideas to your customers or development team by drawing a mockup using Mockup Designer less than a minute.

Here you can see an example image made with Mockup Designer:

It's simplicity comes from the programming language used to develop it: https://red-lang.org 

It is strongly inspired from Mockup Designer from Fatih Erikli (https://github.com/fatiherikli/mockup-designer)
